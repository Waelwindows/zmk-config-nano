#+TITLE: My Keyboard's Configuration

This is where the configuration for my wylderbuilds-made dactyl live. It’s a 4×6 Dactyl Manuform build with
- *Bluetooth Low Energy* (BLE) support /courtesy/ to ZMK
- *Trackball support* using the “PMW3610” optical sensor
- *Colemak* layout with *Home row mods*.
- *RGB underglow*

Thanks to @bullwinkle300 for the initial build/configuration. You can find the rest of their build configurations [[https://github.com/bullwinkle3000/zmk-config-nano][here]].

My version contains a few special things. For one, it’s built using Nix using [[https://github.com/lilyinstarlight/zmk-nix/tree/main][zmk-nix]] setup with the GitHub Actions. Thus, it should be reproducible!
